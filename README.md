# Star Wars survey project
Hi there!

This is a project that I completed as part of my Data Science training in DataQuest.

The present project analyzes data from a Star Wars survey to look for the most viewed and best ranked Star Wars film.

The analysis is mainly focused on data cleaning and data visualization.

I hope you enjoy it!
